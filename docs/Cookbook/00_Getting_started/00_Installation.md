## Installation

s9e\\TextFormatter is developed on the latest version of PHP and is compatible with PHP 5.4.7 and above. In the following examples, you should replace `php5.4` with the lowest version of PHP you want to support: `php5.3`, `php5.4`, `php5.5` or `php5.6`. All versions are functionally identical.

Once installed, you can try this [basic example](https://github.com/s9e/TextFormatter/blob/master/docs/examples/00_quick.php).

}
```
